**Radial Velocity fitting, simulation and mass precision estimation**
- Simulate RV data for given orbital and instrumental parameters
- Fit RV data with MCMC to explore posterior distributions for parameters
- Estimate the precision on mass estimate $M_p\sin{i}$: what precision can you expect from N observations, or how many observations are required to reach a target precision?


## Installation

$ pip install ravest
