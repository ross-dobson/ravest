# ravest
> _(archaic) second-person singular simple present indicative of rave_

**Ravest is currently work-in-progress and in early development. Check back soon for further updates and added features!**


**Radial Velocity fitting, simulation and mass precision estimation**
- Simulate RV data for given orbital and instrumental parameters
- Fit RV data with MCMC to explore posterior distributions for parameters
- Estimate the precision on mass estimate $M_p\sin{i}$: what precision can you expect from N observations, or how many observations are required to reach a target precision?


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install ravest
```

## Usage

See the [example notebook](https://ravest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples/example_model.html) for `ravest.model`.
